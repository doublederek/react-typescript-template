# React TypeScript Template
A simple React & TypeScript template to use as a starting point for web apps

## Setup
- Clone repo locally
- Install all dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install`
- Launch into your Browser with `yarn start` or `npm start`

## Entry Point
- Use `index.tsx` as main entry point
- Dust off your hands because it's that simple
- Enjoy!

## Building
- Build your production app with `yarn build` or `npm build`

## Custom Webpack Archetecture
This template is set up with 3 webpack structures, already implemented. If you don't need to go this deep then you can simply ignore the `.dev` and `.prod` files. No worries!
- `webpack.common.js`: basic webpack structure shared across development and production builds
- `webpack.dev.js`: custom webpack structure specifically for development builds (if needed)
- `webpack.prod.js`: custom webpack structure specifically for production builds (if needed)
